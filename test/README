To get the test using the parameter-set DigisToClusters.txt to work, 
the user has to provide an input file containing StripDigis. 

The user can follow the instructions on

http://home.fnal.gov/~gutsche/software/new_edm/new_edm.html

to convert the needed information from ORCA or download the following file:

wget -O DigisToDigis.root http://home.fnal.gov/~gutsche/software/new_edm/DigisToDigis-<release>.root

where <release> has to be substitutet with pre8, pre9, etc.
